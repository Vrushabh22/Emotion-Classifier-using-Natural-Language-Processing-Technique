# Emotion-Classifier-using-Natural-Language-Processing-Technique

In the domain of text analysis, a sophisticated supervised multi-label classifier system is implemented. Utilizing Linear Support Vector Machines (LinearSVM) achieve 85.01% prediction accuracy, seamlessly integrated this mechanism into the Python ecosystem, employing object-oriented principles for a robust structure.

The primary goal of this project revolves around the implementation of multi-classification to distinguish among 10 distinct emotion labels. These labels encompass a range of sentiments, including neutral, gratitude, admiration, love, amusement, curiosity, approval, optimism, anger, and sadness. To accomplish this, we've employed the GoEmotion dataset, which has been appropriately divided into train and test subsets (imbalanced data) to facilitate training and testing. It's worth noting that the training and test datasets have been provided as part of the coursework, negating the need to attach the original data file.

For illustrative purposes, here's an example of the data employed during both the training and testing phases of the model, aiding in a clearer understanding of the process. The training and testing dataset are anticipated to be in CSV format, featuring two columns: "text" and "label". The "text" column will encompass the Reddit comments, while the "label" column will house the corresponding emotion labels.

# How to Run the project

To maintain simplicity, I have consolidated all components within a single Python Notebook file and also provided a readme file. By navigating through the Notebook, each cell contains comprehensive comments which will help understand the project steps.
